 for a short tutorial.

Please avoid the ["**Resolve conflicts**" button](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/) on GitHub.
 It uses `git merge` instead of `git rebase` which makes the PR commit
history more difficult to read.

Sometimes step 4 will complete without asking for resolution. This is usually
due to difference between how `Cargo.lock` conflict is handled during merge
and rebase. This is normal, and you should still perform step 5 to update
this PR.
